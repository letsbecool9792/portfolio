# ðŸ§­ My Dev Journey â€” Portfolio Site

Welcome to my digital campfire. This is where I chart my journey through code, quests, and side adventures.

## ðŸ”¥ About

An interactive portfolio site that:
- Chronicles my journey as a developer (2019 â†’ now)
- Highlights key projects under **Relics**
- Showcases side quests and experiments
- Uses custom animation, pixel aesthetics, and playful UI

Built with:
- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- No backend. Just vibes.

## âœ¨ Inspiration
Adventure games. Pixel art. RPGs. Old-school loading screens. The itch to build weird stuff.
